  <h2>Different Diabolos</h2>

There are two different types of diabolos. Types without and types with bearings.
Diabolos without bearings are more common. They soly use the acceleration given by the player.

  Bearing diabolos keep the velocity longer and accelerate faster.
  For a beginner this is a good choice, because one can hold the diabolo in one position longer and think about the next move in a sequence.
  Also, it accelerates more easily and is generally more forgiving.
  The drawback is, that few moves using the naturally spin of a diabolo are impossible to play.

  While a player proceeds, he will realize that keeping the diabolo in a vertical postion is much easier with bearings, while genocide tricks and
  playing with multiple diabolos is easier without bearings.

  For a beginner a good starting diabolo without bearings could be from the brand Henry or Taibolo. A good diabolo with bearings comes from Sundia.
  Here I would not recommend a Henry's diabolo, because the axle is very wide. For a beginner that makes it harder to keep the balance.

  <h2>Different Sticks</h2>
  Sticks differ in material and the length. Fiber sticks are elastic and therefore easier on the wrist. Metal sticks are more robust and endure longer.

  The most common way to break a stick is by making them accidently hit the ground repeadetly or throwing the sticks without catching them repeadetly.

  It is rather uncommon to break sticks for a beginner. Even if one proceeds, a stick lasts very many hours of practice.<br><br>
  The length of a stick has mostly two effects. It makes the diabolo gain spin faster. It also makes it harder on the wrist.
  This is just noticed by the player after multiple hours of practice.

  <h2>String Length</h2>
  A good string length is, if one can step on one stick and then pull the other stick up to ones brest. This is a good lenght for most tricks.
  One will realize that some tricks are easier with adjusted string lenght.
