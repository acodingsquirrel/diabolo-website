# Sources of Inspiration

At the beginning it is very important to find out about tricks.
There are two DVDs that most diabolo players have seen a lot of times. They explain the history of diabolo and teach the backbone of diabolo tricks in a structured way. One is named "Planet Diabolo" and the other is "Diabology".

On the internet one should especially take a look at a page called diabolotutorials.
